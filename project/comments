This textfile contains some written comments about our work on the Modern Databases project.

Week1:
We started of full positivity on the amazing journey of programming a database in python based on a b+ tree.
We looked at a document in the course material section on the blackboard.
Only after implementing all code from the text we found that there are actually snippets on the blackboard as well. Ah well, minor setback/time wasted.
From here we spent quite a bit of time understanding the skeleton code, and what a first good step to take was.
We looked up the description of a b+ tree on wikipedia and came to understand that the description in the document provided was close to equal to the description we found on wikipedia.
So we started of with the code to find a key into a tree, which was succesful in the end.
But how can you find something that isn't there so we continued on the insert.

During coding we found out the amount of work on the skeleton-code hadn't been a lot,
resulting in code that was erronous and sometimes not usefull.
E.G. 
-The skeleton-LazyNode class checks if node is empty was just wrong.
 if self.node != if self.node is None
-Also the hasattr in __setitem__ is utterly redundant.
And whilst coding continued onward(slowely) our understanding of the project description dwindled.
The description is vague and oftentimes ambiguous which resulted in us sending an email questioning
the work still ahead for us. This mail was sent after hours of mostly hard work.

In the mail we got back we were belittled for not working hard enough for (third-year) students.
In the end this week was quite frustrating.
Jelte and Abe logging out for week 1.
